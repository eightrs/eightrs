# Eight Rs — Vision Statement

Recycling participation is limited by the inconsistent value of materials.
Aluminum is valuable; glass, plastics, cardboard, paper, and electronics are
often not.

Eight Rs proposes a unified reward layer.

By issuing the 8RS token on Stellar, we give consumers measurable incentives
to recycle materials that normally provide no cash return — creating a more
balanced and equitable recycling economy.

Core principles:

- Environmental integrity  
- Real-time micro-incentives  
- Transparency & auditability  
- Accessibility for low-income communities  
- Circular-economy integration  
- Open-source collaboration  

Eight Rs aims to become a global standard for tokenized sustainability rewards.
