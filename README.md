## What Is Eight Rs?

Eight Rs adds a new “R” to the seven traditional principles of recycling:  
**Reward**

The Eight Rs platform issues the **8RS token** on the Stellar network to reward verified recycling actions. Consumers, municipalities, and businesses
can earn small, instant, transparent digital incentives for sustainable behavior.

This repository contains a *public, non-proprietary* version of the Eight Rs concept for community awareness, timestamping, and grant submissions.

Core business logic and proprietary mechanisms are **not** included.

## Mission
